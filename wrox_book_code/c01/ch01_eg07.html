So, the next<br>word will appear on a new line.</p><p>Without the line break element, new lines are started only when the sentence reaches the end of the screen; this sentence should be long enough to wrap on your screen. Now try resizing your browser window and see how the position where the line wraps onto a new line changes.</p><p>Some Web designers also use this element to control the layout of the document and add extra white space. You can use multiple line break elements to create gaps of several lines, like I am about to do <br><br><br><br><br>here because this text is still in the same paragraph element. Rather than using the line break element to add white space into your documents, it is better to use CSS.</p></body></html>
