Instructions for setting poster image:

1. Create a poster image that is the exact dimension of your video frame. 

	Example: My video is 600 x 450 pixels, my poster image needs to also be 600 by 450 pixels.

2. Name the image "postImage.jpg". It must have this name to be registered by the player as your poster image.

3. Float "postImage.jpg" beside "player.swf".  If it is not in the same directory as "player.swf", the player will not be able to find it unless you alter the code (see below).



I can't have the poster image floating in the same directory as the player.swf file... what can I do?

1. Open the player.fla file.

2. Open the posterImage movie clip.

3. Change the AS in the first frame to point to the directory where you have the poster image.
